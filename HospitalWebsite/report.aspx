    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>This lab involves implementing a web-based solution for the HospitalDB database system. The solution
        includes interfaces for patient registration, staff login, department management, employee/doctor information,
        appointment booking, and hospital information display.</p>

    <h2>2. Implementation Details</h2>
    <p>The project consists of the following HTML pages:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>homePage.html:</strong> The main landing page providing an overview of the hospital, departments,
            about section, and contact information with navigation to all modules.</li>
        <li><strong>login.html:</strong> A staff login form for hospital employees to access the system.</li>
        <li><strong>pat_reg.html:</strong> A patient registration form for collecting patient details and registering
            new patients in the system.</li>
        <li><strong>departments.html:</strong> A page displaying information about various hospital departments and
            their services.</li>
        <li><strong>employees.html:</strong> A comprehensive page showing doctor and staff information, including their
            specialties and contact details.</li>
        <li><strong>Appointments.html:</strong> An appointment booking interface allowing patients to schedule visits
            with doctors.</li>
        <li><strong>dashboard.html:</strong> A central dashboard providing navigation to all lab components including
            problem statement, live demo, and documentation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Design Decisions</h2>
    <p>The interfaces are built using HTML with CSS styling for enhanced user experience. The design follows a modern,
        clean aesthetic with a blue and white color scheme. A consistent navigation bar is used across all pages for
        easy navigation. The layout utilizes flexbox and grid systems for responsive design, ensuring proper structure
        and alignment. Interactive elements include hover effects on cards and buttons, creating an engaging user
        interface. The stylesheet.css file contains shared styles to maintain consistency across all pages.</p>
